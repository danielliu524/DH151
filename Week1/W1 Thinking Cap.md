## Site Agenda
This web map serves as an information database of the location of different game development studios all over the world. There are other similar websites such as https://gamedevmap.com. According to the website, the purpose of the Gamesmith Dev Map is to "Discover, add or edit Game development studios".

## Why does the Website Speaks to Me
As a hobbyist game developer and someone looking to work in the games industry in the future, being able to look at the map and see where the hotspots of the industry are, and how different locations have different types of studios (for example Japan has more console-based studios) is both interesting and useful, and makes me think about my future career prospects.

## How does the Mapping Work
Upon entering the site, the world map is shown with markers scattered across the globe. Users can click on areas of interest to zoom in and examine information about the game development studios, including their name, location, company size, games (and platforms) published and the website of the studio.

## Technologies
The website uses the Google Maps API.

## Changes
The website is very basic. It lacks many useful features such as a search function or a list of all the studios that are in the web map. Navigating the map without a search features makes the process quite tedious. Furthermore, a lot of the text on the map is cluttering the screen, which makes for a bad user experience in my opinion.
