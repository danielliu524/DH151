# Week 6 Thinking Cap

## What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"

"Mapping" refers to the collection of geographical information. It is inherently static, and does not have much depth and layering. "Thick mapping", on the other hand, tells a narrative by providing historical and temporal dynamics and other information when mapping. It is multi-layered to showcase a dynamic mapping, adding depth to the subject, hence the "thick". From the reading as well as learning thick mapping in this class and a previous Digital Humanities class, I think thick mapping is a very useful tool in the digital humanities and is a very interesting use of mapping, as it uses factual data to tell narritives in a visually appealing way.

## How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?

I am taking a geography class this quarter, and the maps in that class showcase the theory of thick mapping very well. Many of the maps are trying to tell a story about the geographical area indirectly. On the daily, many educational Youtube videos made by channels such as Vox make use of thick mapping to tell stories, and these videos have definitely influenced my perception of world relations and events.
